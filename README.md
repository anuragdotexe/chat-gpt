# chatGPT Bookmark
[ChatGPT conversation saving bookmark](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt).

It's started as [DEV.to article](https://dev.to/jcubic/save-chatgpt-as-html-file-dhh).
But I've decided that It would be better to track it on GitHub and update so it will still work,
when OpenAI change their web application.

## What is Bookmarklet?
Bookmarklet is a JavaScript code that run as URL from your bookmarks. To run the code you need to
create new Bookmark and copy the code from the

don't know how you can open the [website](https://jcubic.github.io/chat-gpt/) and drag & drop the
link to your bookmarks.

You can read more about [Bookmarklets on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet).
