# 📖 ChatGPT Bookmark

Welcome to the **ChatGPT conversation-saving bookmark project**! What started as a fun experiment in a [DEV.to article](https://dev.to/jcubic/save-chatgpt-as-html-file-dhh) has now grown into something much more exciting. As I worked on it, I realized that **keeping it on GitHub** would make it easier to **maintain, improve, and ensure it keeps working** even if OpenAI makes changes to their web application. This project is a simple, clever tool to **save your ChatGPT conversations as files**, so you never lose any of your important exchanges.

## 🔖 What is a Bookmarklet?

If you’ve never used a **bookmarklet** before, don’t worry—it’s simpler than it sounds. A **bookmarklet** is a small piece of JavaScript code that **runs like a magic spell** directly from your browser’s bookmarks. All you need to do is **create a new bookmark** and copy the code from our [bookmark.js file](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt/blob/master/bookmark.js). If this sounds complicated, just visit the [bookmarklet page](https://jcubic.github.io/chat-gpt/) and **drag & drop the provided link into your bookmarks**. That’s it—your personal ChatGPT conversation-saver is ready!

And if you're still curious about how bookmarklets work, check out this [Wikipedia article on Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for a deep dive into their magic.

## 🌟 Why This Project Matters

The primary reason for creating this project was to provide an **easy way to save ChatGPT conversations locally**. We know how valuable these chats can be—whether it’s brainstorming ideas, coding tips, or personal journaling. Instead of losing those thoughtful exchanges, **why not store them safely on your computer** for future reference?

Over time, users have found some creative and exciting ways to use this tool. Here's an example of **a unique project someone built** using the bookmarklet:
- **[Sync ChatGPT conversations with Amazon S3](http://scripting.com/2023/03/08/153909.html):** Automatically back up your chat logs to the cloud!

## 🛠️ How You Can Contribute

This project is **open for contributions**, and we welcome anyone who’d like to **improve, expand, or fix bugs**. If the code doesn’t work (hey, bugs happen!), please **report an issue**.  

If you’re adding a feature, here’s a little checklist to follow:
1. **Run the bookmark** and make sure your changes work as intended.
2. **Download a saved file** using the new version of the bookmark.
3. Add the saved file to the repository inside the folder labeled with the **current date**.
4. **Update the `index.html` file** with a link to your saved file. This way, we can track how the bookmark evolves over time—kind of like a **living changelog**!
